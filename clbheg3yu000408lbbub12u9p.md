# Day 1: Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software. DevOps aims to increase collaboration and communication between teams, automate processes, and improve efficiency and productivity.

We were the bridge between development and operations, pushing the changes to production and managing the stability and resilience of our applications.

To achieve this, devOps teams use various tools and technologies, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems, cloud computing platforms, and automation tools. These tools help teams automate and streamline their software development and deployment processes, enabling them to deliver new features and updates to users more quickly and reliably.

DevOps is a way of working that helps teams create better software and provide better user experiences. By fostering collaboration and communication and using the right tools and technologies, DevOps teams can build and deploy software faster and more efficiently, respond to user feedback, and changing business requirements more effectively.

Happy coding, my nerds! ðŸ¤“
