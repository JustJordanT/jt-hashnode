## Day 1  - What are Data Structures and Algorithms

We tend to use Data structures & Algorithms every day unintentionally, from using GPS for sorting our mail to even cooking our favorite meals.

### Data Structures

I like to think of data structures like boxes that we can use while programming and ways that we can organize our data in a more usable from a computing standpoint.

Data structures are a big topic in computer science; there are many different structures that we have at our fingertips. Does this mean we should just use them all?

Not quite, data structures and algorithms can be thought of like tools; given a job, a hammer might not be the best tool for the job.

Finding the right tool for the job is what we are looking trying to do, getting the job done in the most efficient way possible.  

### Algorithms 

Now when looking at algorithms, these are the instructions for our tools and how we tell our program to use the tools that we are providing it.

Algorithms provide the set of instructions for our program; take a look at our following program we have a simple class `Math` with two methods; reading over this, we can see for our inputs we are taking in 2 numbers `n1`, `n2` and out program has instructions for these inputs. 


``` csharp
public class Math
{
   public int Add(int n1, int n2)
   {
      return n1 + n2
   }

   public int Subtract(int n1, int n2)
   {
      return n1 - n2 
   } 
}
```

 As always, happy coding, my friends! ðŸ˜Š
