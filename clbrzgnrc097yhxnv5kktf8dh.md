![How to Host your App on the Cloud with AWS Using a Multi-Cloud Strategy](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.jfrog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F20131144%2FBlog-ECS-ECR.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=3cb1c5e9c811d1c25b77b21b83aaa62d61e47d5eaa417c64461609cfbea383e7&ipo=images align="left")

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a popular cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services for developing, deploying, and managing applications. These services can be part of a DevOps workflow to automate and accelerate the development and deployment process.

Here are some examples of how AWS services can be used in a DevOps workflow:

1.  Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to run, scale, and secure Docker containers.
    
2.  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes storing, managing, and deploying Docker images easy.
    
3.  AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that automates applications' build, test, and deployment. It can automate the release process for applications deployed on ECS or other AWS services.
    
4.  AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces artifacts ready for deployment. It can be used to build and test Docker images before deploying them to ECS or other AWS services.
    
5.  AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed version control service that makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code. It can be used to track changes to application code and infrastructure as code in a DevOps workflow.
    
6.  AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows developers to use templates to create and manage AWS infrastructure as code. This can automate the provisioning and management of resources needed to run an application.
    

DevOps teams can automate and accelerate the development and deployment process using these and other AWS services, enabling them to deliver applications and updates to customers faster.
