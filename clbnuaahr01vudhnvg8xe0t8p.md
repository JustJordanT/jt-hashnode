# Day 6: The Importance of Automation in DevOps



Automation is a critical component of DevOps. By automating processes, teams can save time, reduce errors, and improve the reliability and consistency of their work. Let's take a look at some common areas for automation in DevOps.



## Continuous integration and delivery

Automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software can help teams deliver high-quality software faster. 

### Continuous integration (CI)
 A software development practice that regularly integrates code changes into a shared code repository. The goal of continuous integration is to detect and resolve conflicts and errors in the code as early as possible to ensure that the software is always in a stable and deployable state. 

### Continuous delivery (CD) 
A practice that involves frequently releasing small changes and improvements to a software application. The goal of continuous delivery is to enable organizations to deliver software updates and improvements to their users quickly and reliably. In a continuous delivery environment, new code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the production environment without requiring manual intervention.

## Configuration management
Automating the deployment and configuration of software can save time and reduce the risk of errors; some of these tools you may have heard of, like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/solutions/devops), [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)

## Monitoring and alerting
Automating the monitoring and alerting of software can help teams quickly identify and address any issues. There are different ways to go about monitoring, from what to monitor to how and why.
