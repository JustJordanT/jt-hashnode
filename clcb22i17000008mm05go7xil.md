# Continues integration vs. Continues deployment

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. Automated builds and tests are run on the updated codebase. CI aims to detect integration errors as quickly as possible so that developers can fix them as soon as they occur rather than waiting until later in the development process.

Continuous deployment (CD) is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. CD takes the idea of CI one step further by automatically releasing code changes to users rather than requiring manual intervention. CD aims to get code changes into production as quickly and safely as possible, intending to improve the speed and reliability of software updates.

CI focuses on integrating code changes, while CD focuses on deploying those changes to production. Both practices are designed to improve the speed and reliability of software development. They are often used in conjunction with one another as part of a larger continuous delivery (CD) process.
