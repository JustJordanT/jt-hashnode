# Clean Coder

Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," is a leading figure in software development. With decades of experience as a programmer, software engineer, and author, Martin has become an expert on clean coding principles.

In his book, "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship," Martin provides detailed guidance on writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. He argues that clean code is essential for building high-quality software and creating a sustainable development process.

One of the key ideas in Martin's book is the importance of following a set of coding standards and principles. These standards and regulations help to ensure that code is consistent, easy to read, and well-structured. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and work with the code, which in turn, helps to reduce the likelihood of errors and bugs.

In addition to guiding how to write clean code, Martin also emphasizes the importance of adopting the right mindset and attitude as a developer. In his book "The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers," he discusses software developers' ethical and professional responsibilities and provides practical advice on maintaining a high level of professionalism.

Another principle he goes over is making sure you are investing in yourself. I have had bad or good habits of buying too many Udemy courses; the way I see it, it‚Äôs easier than digging around YouTube trying to find that thing you want to learn. He details that for every 40 hours you work, you should spend 20 hours investing in yourself; a couple of hours here and there will inevitably show over time.

Being able to say no, he goes into detail about when and how to say no when issues arise, things get added to a project; communication wasn‚Äôt clean at the beginning. Now they want to hold you to the same timeline you had given the scope was smaller. Saying Yes when you should be saying no can be bad for you and others; just because you are going to try harder doesn‚Äôt mean you will get more time to work on a project; we are all human. We have 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

He also goes on about asking for help when needed and how Pair programming can be one of your most essential tools. I could go on and on about this book, but overall, Robert C. Martin's clean coding work has significantly impacted the software development community. His books and teachings have helped to promote the principles of clean code and have inspired many developers to improve the quality of their work.

Happy Coding! üë®üèΩ‚Äçüöíüèó
